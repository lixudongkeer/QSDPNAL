# QSDPNAL
A MATLAB software for convex quadratic semidefinite programming  with inequality, equality and bound constraints

This project is the implementation of the algorithms introduced in the paper 

Xudong Li, Defeng Sun, and Kim-Chuan Toh, QSDPNAL: A two-phase augmented Lagrangian method for convex quadratic semidefinite programming, Mathematical Programming Computation, 10 (2018), pp. 703--743.

The project now moves to https://github.com/MatOpt/QSDPNAL
